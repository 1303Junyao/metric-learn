# metric_learn

Metric Learning algorithms in Python.

Currently implemented:

 * Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN)
 * Information Theoretic Metric Learning (ITML)
 * Sparse Determinant Metric Learning (SDML)
 * Least Squares Metric Learning (LSML)

For usage examples, see `test.py` and `demo.py`.

Dependencies:

 * Python 2.6+
 * numpy, scipy, scikit-learn
 * (for the demo only: matplotlib)
